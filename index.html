<p>Arguably, method and theory forms the foundation of any academic field or discipline. What makes understanding these complex, however, is that there is no single method and theory for any discipline. In fact, it is quite possible that the diversity of method and theory is what keeps academia vibrant and effective. Moreover, it is useful to explore some of the current methods and theories in Digital Archaeology and consider how this may develop in the future.</p>

<p>“Digital Archaeology is Here” by Andre Costopoulos<sup>1</sup> explores how to do archaeology digitally and what it means to be a digital archaeologist today. From understanding the digitization of archaeology to the use of digital tools, Costopoulos effectively demonstrates how archaeologists have been on the cusp of new media and communications technology for many years, and this has only increased over time. Thus, Costopoulos discusses how technology is increasingly becoming a key factor in the method and theory of digital archaeologists, along with the more traditional aims and practices of archaeologists. To conclude, the author notes how the problems facing digital archaeologists are not new, but are indeed changing as a result of new technological developments. Overall, this article effectively demonstrates how the method and theory of digital archaeologists, while always faced with a host of issues, is nonetheless being affected by the digital age.</p>
      
<p>Eric C. Kansa’s “Click Here to Save Archaeology”<sup>2</sup> explores a fundamental component of Digital Archaeology: data. In particular, he explores “slow data,” which is “the digitized aspects of slow archaeology, or “the notion that we as a professional community should emphasize excellence in the research process.” Processing and interpreting data is becoming an increasingly important part of Digital Archaeology. Between “slow data” and “big data,” archaeologists are becoming increasingly faced with large, complex amounts of data. By adapting the idea of slow archaeology to data analysis, Kansa notes how archaeologists can “articulate more human and insightful approaches to the ‘datafication’ of archaeology.” New technologies, platforms, and so forth are not enough, according to Kansa, to “promote ethical practice or more nuanced understandings of the past.” In summary, Kansa claims that there must be long-term institutional and financial mechanisms to further expand the field. In order to avoid the subversion of ethics and goals, efforts must be made to “work toward a better institutional foundation” that can effectively accommodate both traditional and digital archaeology.</p>
      
<p>In “A Digital Public Archaeology,” Lorna Richardson<sup>3</sup> discusses how there has been a “limited amount of theoretical scrutiny” on Digital Public Archaeology. The ways in which research can be collected, shared, and discussed as a result of new technologies has created new expectations and opportunities for public archaeology, especially in regards to how participation and interaction can occur. With new opportunities, however, Richardson comments on the new responsibilities that will arise, especially in relation to ethical concerns. She concludes by stating that there is much potential for the Internet to guide archaeology and affect the “impact and presentation of Public Archaeology.” Additionally, she addresses how new methods and theories are contributing to a new relationship between archaeologists and the public as a result of new, digital technologies.</p>
      
<h3>Method and Theory in the Future</h3>
      
<p>In conclusion, as the discipline begins to change, so too must the methods and theories that digital archaeologists employ. Costopolous, Kansa, and Richardson explore important dimensions of Digital Archaeology and how the methods and theories are changing. With the way archaeologists are approaching digitization, the transformation of data, and the impact of digital technologies on public archaeology, it is clear that the aims and practices of archaeology are changing significantly. As Digital Archaeology arguably continues to develop into its own discipline, however, how may this continue to affect methods and theories? As with technology, no one can know for sure how methods and theories may change in the future. The above discussion, however, seems to point to the fact that archaeologists must be able and willing to adapt to changes in the discipline. Whether one views method and theory as shaping the discipline or vice versa, it is clear that Digital Archaeology is transforming rapidly and will likely continue to in the future. Indeed, the transformation and development of Digital Archaeology will also have significant consequences on another key component of the discipline: the ethics.</p>
